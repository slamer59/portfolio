The image in the Home page is generated by midjourney and can not be shared commercially that is why I have provided placeholder image instead. For your personal projects you can generate the image you want using midjourney and replace it with the placeholder image. The steps to generate such image are shown in the video and also prompt is given in the public folder via prompts.txt file.
